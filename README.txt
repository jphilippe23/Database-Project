Production dataset was created using the tool SQLizer, which converts spreadsheet files to MySQL relations.
Our info on supreme court justices and cases was acquired at http://scdb.wustl.edu.
Our info on the presidents was acquired at https://datahub.io/dataset/list-of-us-presidents/resource/ba0cdb03-c0f0-45ff-a21f-63fdf6ce1a89.
Our production statements are still a work in progress, but we will have them figured out!
